# React Router Version 6

### Description

In this exercise we are going to learn the basics about the react-router-dom. After this exercise, you will have 
acquired solid understanding of routing and how to solve the tasks that await you later this semester.

The exercises are divided in 9 lessons. In each lesson you will be presented with some tasks that
you need to solve.

The first lesson will be on branch **lesson-01**. After solving the tasks you can check out to the next lesson
until branch **lesson-final**.

You will work on two seperated windows. The first window you are going to solve the tasks that are given to you and the 
second (git repo) is for comparing. The solution for each lesson is on the branch ahead.

```
You are only going to be cheating yourself by peeking ahead! Try first
to come up with your own solution. Don't be a cheater!!!
```

### What to do!
